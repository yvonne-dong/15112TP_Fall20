# Description -
“Escape from the Pajama Party” is an Adventure Time themed room escape game. Players will attempt to walk through a maze, and in the maze they will encounter multiple locked rooms and will have to solve puzzles in order to get out. 
In each room, players will interact with a character and create a dish from the series for them as the “key” to get out. Players will collect items by looking around the room, solving tasks, combining items and other methods to create the required dish. Some of the tasks will be timed and will affect the final score. Every new game will generate a new maze and will position the rooms at different locations.
